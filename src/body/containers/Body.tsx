All workshops and engagement sessions will happen in-person while being live-streamed on Discord. Our sponsors will join Discord to interact with you if you participate online. Judging for online participants will take place through Discord too. When we invite you to the event, the email will specify whether we would be able to offer you a place offline. We would really hope to accommodate everyone offline, but your safety and health is our top one priority.",
