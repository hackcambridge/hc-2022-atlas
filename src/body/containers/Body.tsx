All workshops and engagement sessions will happen in-person while being live-streamed on Discord. Our sponsors will join Discord to interact with you if you participate online. Judging for online participants will take place through Discord too. When we invite you to the event, the email will specify whether we would be able to offer you a place offline.

    {
        question: "What is your current covid-19 policies if I am attending the event in-person?",
        answer: `Your registration, RSVP, fully-vaccinated status (or exemption) AND a negative result for a Covid-19 test taken within 24 hours of the event entitles you to admittance to the in-person HackCambridge Atlas event. Rather than using COVID Pass, we require a text or email notification of your test from NHS Test and Trace as a condition of entry*.
        Registration opens at 0900 on Saturday the 22nd of January. We require you to have taken a negative PCR or rapid lateral flow test within 24 hours of the event, preferably within 12 hours. As our event is >30 hours long, we will not accept tests taken on Thursday, even if they are within 48 hours of registration. The Government advises that “to strengthen the protection testing provides you should take tests as late as possible before attending the event, ideally within 12 hours”
        Fully-vaccinated status means that you you are vaccinated with 2 doses of an approved vaccine (or one of the single-dose Janssen vaccine). By attending our in-person event you declare that you do meet the criteria outlined above. The vaccines approved in the UK can be found on the government website: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/countries-with-approved-covid-19-vaccination-programmes-and-proof-of-vaccination.
        *If that is not your case or  if you think you are exempt from either or both of our COVID requirements, please email us (team@hackcambridge.com) and we will judge on a case-by-case basis.
        We would require you to prepare at least two sets of lateral flow test kit (one for entering the event venue and one more as a back up in case of emergency/if you leave the venue during the event). We would require the result of LFT to be reported to NHS thus your test kits must be the NHS-approved ones. More details on this will come together with the event invitation. There have been news articles about the shortage of LFTs, thus we would encourage you to prepare the kits in advance - especially if you are arriving in Cambridge very close to the event. You can use the NHS website to find out where to get rapid lateral flow tests.
